# spaSim

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of spaSim (**spa**tial **Sim**ulator) is to facilitate tissue image simulations! It simulates cells with 2D locations (point data) and cell types in a tissue. The available patterns include  background cells, cell clusters, immune cell rings and vessels. It also enables simulations that generate a set of images in one run!

As quantitative tools for spatial tissue image analysis have been developed and need benchmarking, simulations from spaSim can be applied to test and benchmark these tools and metrics. The output of spaSim are images in SingleCellExperiment object format and can be used with SPIAT (SPIAT (**Sp**atial **I**mage **A**nalysis of **T**issues) also developed by out team.

Here shows some comparisons between real images and simulated images from spaSim. The red points are tumour cells; blue and green points are immune cells, and gray points are unspecified cell types.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/spaSim-examples.png")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of spaSim like so:

``` {r}
# enable this later
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("TrigosTeam/spaSim")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to simulate background cells with multiple cell types of different proportions.

```{r example}
library(spaSim)
set.seed(610)
mix_background <- TIS(n_cells = 5000, width = 2000, height = 2000, min_d = 10,
                      names_of_bg_cells = c("Tumour","Immune","Others"), 
                      proportions_of_bg_cells = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.7),
                      plot_image = TRUE)
```

## Vignette
