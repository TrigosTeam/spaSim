Description: A suite of functions for simulating spatial patterns of cells in 
    tissue images. Output imagesare multitype point data in SingleCellExperiment 
    format. Each point represents a cell, with its 2D locations and cell type. 
    Potential cell patterns include background cells, tumour/immune cell clusters, 
    immune rings, and blood/lymphatic vessels.
